        I here at Labyrinth Team Games hate ads on websites and games as much as everyone else so I decided not to use them at all! But sadly, now as a developer I understand the need for them.
      </p>
      <p class="donate-message">
        Developing software takes time and resources, paying for a server and domain name also isn't free, so I decided to have the option of donating.
      </p>
      <p class="donate-message">
        By showing your support towards my first game I will keep it ad-free and continue to make such projects!
      </p>
      <p class="donate-message">
        Feel free to check my code at any time and to send suggestions on game design and code design on my email labyrinthteamgames@gmail.com!
